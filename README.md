Create platform-independent documents and presentations

<hr/>

<b>DESCRIPTION : </b><br/>
This project aims to provide users to create presentations and documents using web technologies, and store them locally, so that it can be accessed again for further edition, or presentation.<br/>
jQuery and Bootstrap, and many similar front-end frameworks have provided web developers with a lot of creative animations and formatting. This project leverages these features to create presentations that are responsive, ability to embed many file types including audio and video, and better management and user-friendly workspace.
